# my cursor rule

This file configures Cursor's behavior to meet specific requirements.

## General Rules

- **Contextual Reading:** Always read all relevant documents in the project before answering, to obtain sufficient context.
- **Network Information Retrieval:** When necessary, retrieve more information and update knowledge by searching the web.

## Example Workflow
1. The user raises a question.
2. Cursor checks all relevant documents in the project.
3. Cursor retrieves information from the web if necessary.
4. Cursor provides the user with a clear and organized answer based on the above steps.
