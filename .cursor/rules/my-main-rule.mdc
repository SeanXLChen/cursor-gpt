# my cursor rule

This file configures Cursor's behavior to meet specific requirements.

## General Rules

- **Contextual Reading:** Always read all relevant documents in the project before answering, to obtain sufficient context.
- **Network Information Retrieval:** When necessary, retrieve more information and update knowledge by searching the web.

## MCP Usage

Use the following MCP protocols and emphasize:

1. **markdown mcp:**
   - Purpose: Convert PDF files to Markdown format.
   - Trigger: When the user requests information from a PDF or when PDF content needs to be converted to a more readable format.

2. **sequential-thinking mcp:**
   - Purpose: Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and reason step-by-step to improve the logic and accuracy of answers.
   - Trigger: When the user's question involves multiple steps or requires sequential reasoning. This helps provide more accurate and organized responses.

## Example Workflow

1. The user raises a question.
2. Cursor checks all relevant documents in the project.
3. Cursor retrieves information from the web if necessary.
4. If a file contains PDF content, Cursor uses markdown mcp to convert it to Markdown.
5. Cursor uses sequential-thinking mcp to break down complex problems and reason step-by-step.
6. Cursor provides the user with a clear and organized answer based on the above steps.
