## Sequential Thinking MCP Server

This project supports integration with the [Sequential Thinking MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking).

**Purpose:**  
The Sequential Thinking MCP server helps break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and provides step-by-step reasoning to improve the logic and accuracy of answers.

**Usage:**  
- Ensure the Sequential Thinking MCP server is running (see the official repo for setup instructions).
- Configure your system or workflow to send complex, multi-step queries to the MCP server endpoint.
- The server will return structured, step-by-step reasoning and solutions.

For more details and advanced configuration, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking).
